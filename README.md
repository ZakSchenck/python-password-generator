# Password Generator with Python
## Description
My first ever project made with Python. I decided to learn Python after using Javascript for so long and this took around 45 minutes to complete on day one while mostly looking up syntax. It deals with user input deciding what I would like to randomize in the password. After that it takes all the conditions and randomizes a password based on the desired password length. It ranges from four characters up to thirty.

## Project Hurtles
Not many hurtles at all, as this is a pretty basic project. Getting used to some of the syntax was probably the reason it wasn't a ten minute project.
