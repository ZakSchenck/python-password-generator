# Password Generator with Python
## Description
My first ever project made with Python. I decided to learn Python after using Javascript for so long and this took around 45 minutes to complete, mostly looking up syntax. It deals with user input deciding what I would like to randomize in the password. After that it takes all the conditions and randomizes a password based on the desired password length. It ranges from four characters up to thirty.
